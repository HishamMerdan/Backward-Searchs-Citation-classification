<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Reputation systems in digital workplaces increase transaction e ciency by building trust and reducing information asymmetry. These systems, however, do not yet capture the dynamic multidimensional nature of online work. By uniformly aggregating reputation scores across worker skills, they ignore skillset-specific heterogeneity (reputation attribution), and they implicitly assume that a worker's quality does not change over time (reputation staticity). Even further, reputation scores tend to be overly positive (reputation inflation), and as a result, they often fail to di↵erentiate workers e ciently. This work presents a new augmented intelligence reputation framework that combines human input with machine learning to provide dynamic, multi-dimensional, and skillset-specific worker reputation. The framework includes three components: The first component maps skillsets into a latent space of finite competency dimensions (word embedding), and as a result, it directly addresses reputation attribution.</p><p>The second builds dynamic competency-specific quality assessment models (hidden Markov models) that solve reputation staticity. The final component aggregates these competency-specific assessments to generate skillset-specific reputation scores. Application of this framework on a dataset of 58,459 completed tasks from a major online labor market shows that, compared with alternative reputation systems, the proposed approach (1) yields more appropriate rankings of workers that form a closer-to-normal reputation distribution, (2) better identifies "non-perfect" workers who are more likely to underperform and are harder to predict, and (3) improves the ranking of within-opening choices and yields significantly better outcomes. Additional analysis of 77,044 restaurant reviews shows that the proposed framework successfully generalizes to alternative contexts, where assigned feedback scores are overly positive and service quality is multidimensional and dynamic.</p></div>

These systems rely on human input: employers rate workers for the tasks they complete, and these ratings become part of the workers' online resumes. Such reputation mechanisms measure expected service quality <ref type="bibr">(Rahman 2018b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Filippas et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2016)</ref>, and as a result, they increase employers' trust in workers' abilities and facilitate market transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Yoganarasimhan 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">, Moreno and Terwiesch 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, Lin et al. 2016)</ref>. Besides, workers realize how reputation instills trust and a↵ects employer choices, and tend to readjust their premiums according to their reputation scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Banker and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hwang 2008, Gandini et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Despite these benefits, the design of current reputation systems does not capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of online work. In particular, reputation systems in online labor markets implicitly assume (by uniformly averaging all prior feedback scores) that worker quality and expertise are not evolving <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hendrikx et al. 2015)</ref>. However, current trends show that new skills are born and old skills die faster than ever <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Autor et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Autor 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">, Oliver 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2016)</ref>. As a result, to remain marketable, online workers must be diligently and continuously re-educating and reskilling themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Kuhn and Skuterud 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">, Stevenson 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">, Oliver 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, online worker reputation scores are unidimensional and skillset-independent. Digital workplaces, however, are highly heterogeneous in terms of qualifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2014)</ref>, while online workers tend to complete tasks that require diverse skillsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2016</ref>). As a result, these unidimensional reputation scores cannot provide accurate estimates of skillset-specific expertise. Finally, on par with other online platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hu et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hu et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">, Zervas et al. 2015)</ref>, online worker reputation scores tend to be overly positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Abhinav et al. 2017)</ref>. Such inflated scores do not su ciently di↵erentiate workers, as most of them are rated as "better than average" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Given these shortcomings of current reputation systems in online labor markets, how can we design dynamic, multidimensional, skillset-specific reputation frameworks? To address this question, I propose an intelligence augmentation (IA) system that relies on three design principles: <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(1)</ref> Mapping of any combination of arbitrary skills into a latent space of finite competency dimensions (Word Embedding), <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(2)</ref> dynamic competency-specific quality assessment (hidden Markov models), and (3) aggregation of these competency-specific assessments. Decomposition of skills to competencies facilitates skillset-specific reputation. Dynamic quality assessment explains the evolution of workers as they learn new skills and gain expertise. Aggregation of the competency-specific quality assessments for any given combination of skills results in representative (normal-like) skillset-specific reputation distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schmidt and Hunter 1983)</ref> that catalyze worker di↵erentiation.</p><p>Analysis of 58,459 completed tasks from a major online labor market shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms ten alternative advanced reputation systems (including the market's current reputation system, systems that rely on link analysis, gradient boosting, neural networks, and adaptations of recommender systems). In particular, compared with these systems, the proposed approach (1) yields more appropriate rankings of workers that form a closer-tonormal reputation distribution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(2)</ref> better identifies "non-perfect" workers who are more likely to underperform and are harder to predict, and (3) improves the ranking of within-opening choices and yields significantly better outcomes. Additional analysis of 77,044 restaurant reviews shows that the proposed framework successfully generalizes to alternative contexts, where assigned feedback scores are overly positive and service quality is multidimensional and dynamic.</p><p>This work is the first to identify shortcomings of current reputation systems of online labor markets and to present design principles that future reputation systems should have in order to estimate a worker's dynamic and multidimensional reputation. By solidifying these principles into di↵erent components, the proposed IA framework combines human input with machine intelligence to result in accurate, skillset-specific reputation scores. Such accurate scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(1)</ref> help workers to di↵erentiate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(2)</ref> guide employers to make informed and fast (reduced search cost; see Bakos 1997) decisions, and (3) enable the market to improve its recommendation algorithms but also to understand the supply distributions across latent competencies. By predicting underperforming workers, the framework preemptively informs employers, an intervention that could reduce the number of adverse outcomes. Positive outcomes increase participation in the marketplace, thereby generating a continuous stream of revenue for the platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tripp and Grégoire 2011)</ref>.</p><p>This IA framework also highlights how combining human input with advanced machine learning techniques can augment intelligence by creating the necessary conditions for humans to make informed decisions. Such systems have the potential to increase e ciency and outcome quality precisely because they intelligently di↵erentiate workers (i.e., identify each individual's latent qualities). E cient di↵erentiation can further guide labor supply redistribution (e.g., by motivating workers to re-educate) and inform career path advisers <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2020)</ref>. As a result, the deployment of the proposed IA framework in di↵erent types of online platforms could have implications for workers, employers, businesses, and the future of work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Overview of current reputation systems designs</head><p>Given this established impact of online reputation systems, prior research has focused on improving their design and increasing their performance. Researchers have proposed reputation systems that have context-specific objectives and serve alternative domains such as e-commerce platforms, online communities, crowdsourcing platforms, and peer-to-peer networks. Based on their architecture, I cluster existing reputation systems into human-based, machine-based, and hybrid (human and machine).</p><p>2.1.1. Human-based reputation systems: Most commercial reputation systems rely solely on human ratings (e.g., in online marketplaces; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Tadelis 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">, Luca 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Einav et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, Amazon users post reviews, rate products, and rate other reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Amazon 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, eBay sellers and buyers leave feedback for each other (eBay 2018). This feedback reflects both an overall rating (good, neutral, and negative), but also numerical ratings for accuracy, communication, shipping time, and shipping charges. A similar reputation system appears in many online question-and-answer communities (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Stackoverflow and discourse communities)</ref>, where users up-vote or down-vote responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Stackoverflow 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kokkodis et al. 2020b</ref>). Third-party reputation platforms that allow users to review and rate are also available for multiple products and services, such as restaurants and hotels (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp; see <ref type="bibr">Kokkodis and Lappas 2020)</ref> and Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) users <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Turkopticon 2018</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Machine-based reputation systems:</head><p>Machine-based approaches do not require human raters. Instead, they often rely on network analysis to identify user quality. In online and question-answering communities, such methods focus on identifying expert (or helpful) users <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Jurczyk and Agichtein 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">, Zhang et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Bouguessa et al. 2008)</ref>. In large organizations, proposed approaches combine information retrieval and graph-based techniques to analyze user social (and other) profiles and identify areas of expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Balog and De Rijke 2007)</ref>. Similarly, peer-to-peer network reputation systems use network analysis to estimate the sharing quality of each participating node <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Kamvar et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>2.1.3. Hybrid reputation systems: Many reputation systems combine information from human raters with machine learning and network analysis. Such hybrid approaches are examples of IA systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Jain et al. 2018)</ref>, as they enhance human judgment by combining artificial and human intelligence. The most basic ones combine ratings with information from social and other online sources <ref type="bibr">(Sabater and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sierra 2001a,b, Hendrikx and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Bubendorfer 2013)</ref>. These systems are tailored for e-commerce platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hendrikx and Bubendorfer 2013)</ref>. For online communities, hybrid approaches use human cognitive traits along with subjective logic to identify experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Pelechrinis et al. 2015)</ref>. At the same time, peer-to-peer networks require di↵erent types of hybrid reputation systems that combine network analysis along with ratings and the personal histories of each node to estimate node trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Damiani et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Curtis et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">, Xiong and Liu 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">, Tian and Yang 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Hybrid reputation systems also appear in crowdsourcing settings (e.g., AMT; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Allahbakhsh et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Jagabathula et al. 2014)</ref>. For instance, some reputation management models include a rater's credibility along with information from each worker's set of completed tasks to estimate worker quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Allahbakhsh et al. 2012)</ref>. Similarly, and in order to filter out adversarial workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jagabathula et al. 2014)</ref>, proposed reputation systems in crowdsourcing settings penalize workers with a poor reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Xie et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Reputation systems in online labor markets</head><p>Similar to most e-commerce platforms, online labor markets o↵er reputation systems that allow workers to receive feedback for the tasks they complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">, Wood-Doughty 2018)</ref>. Over a series of completed tasks, these feedback scores accumulate to generate a worker's reputation on the platform <ref type="bibr">(Rahman 2018a)</ref>. Worker reputation "institutes trust among quasistrangers" <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Nica et al. 2017)</ref>, and as a result, increases marketplace e ciency by reducing information asymmetry <ref type="bibr">(Kokkodis et al. 2015)</ref>. In particular, worker reputation is a major driving force in hiring choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Yoganarasimhan 2013)</ref>, and it correlates positively with worker earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Banker and Hwang 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Gandini et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">, Moreno and Terwiesch 2014)</ref>. Even having a reputation (compared with being new in the market) improves a worker's current <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Lin et al. 2016</ref>) and subsequent hiring chances <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Pallais 2014)</ref>. These reputation e↵ects are not uniform, as positive verified information appears to disproportionately benefit workers from less developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Agrawal et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Kanat et al. 2018)</ref>. Finally, reputation is not necessarily category-specific; it transfers across multiple task categories that require diverse skillsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2016</ref>).</p><p>2.2.1. Shortcomings of reputation systems in online labor markets: Despite these multidimensional e↵ects, reputation systems in online labor markets are not perfect <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018)</ref>, as they experience: (1) reputation inflation, (2) reputation attribution, and (3) reputation staticity.</p><p>Reputation inflation: Similar to other online marketplaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Zervas et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hu et al. 2017)</ref>, reputation scores in online labor markets are highly inflated <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Abhinav et al. 2017)</ref>. This inflation happens mainly for two reasons. First, users who receive low feedback scores cannot get hired, and as a result, they abandon the marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Jerath et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Jøsang and Golbeck 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Jøsang et al. 2007)</ref>. Second, employers feel peer pressure to assign positive ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018)</ref>. The combination of the two yields reputation distributions that are positively skewed, where every worker is assumed to be "better than average." Such inflated reputation scores do not su ciently di↵erentiate workers, as they form noisy estimates of service quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hendrikx et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Reputation attribution: At the same time, current reputation systems in online labor markets provide unidimensional reputation scores that describe overall service quality. However, these digital workplaces are highly heterogeneous in terms of qualifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2014)</ref>, as they o↵er tasks that require a diverse range of skills (e.g., logo design, software development, data analytics, marketing skills). Besides, workers often do not focus on specific types of tasks, but instead, they complete tasks that require diverse skillsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2016)</ref>. The existence of this highly heterogeneous environment in terms of skills suggests that unidimensional reputation scores cannot capture skill-specific qualities. For instance, consider a worker who provides an IT service and completes a task that requires networking, C, and Python. When the task is over, this worker receives a feedback score of 0.9. Does this score capture the worker's service quality on networking, on C, on Python, or on any combination of these skills?</p><p>Reputation staticity: Finally, the rapid evolution of skills and worker expertise in online labor markets further limits current reputation systems. Because new skills are born and old skills die faster than ever before <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Autor et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Autor 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">, Oliver 2015)</ref>, workers need to continuously keep re-educating themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Kuhn and Skuterud 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">, Stevenson 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">, Oliver 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Kokkodis 2020)</ref>. Workers are therefore dynamic entities that evolve by either gaining expertise on skills they know, or by investing in learning new skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2020)</ref>. Current reputation systems assume that the quality of a service does not change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Jøsang et al. 2007)</ref>, as they uniformly average received ratings to provide an aggregate quality score <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hendrikx et al. 2015)</ref>. This assumption is valid for a product in an e-commerce platform (e.g., a book or a camera), but it is misleading in representing the quality of a worker who gains expertise and acquires new skills over time.</p><p>These shortcomings of reputation systems in online labor markets result in service quality estimates that are often not predictive of future worker performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Filippas et al. 2018)</ref>. Consequently, decisions based on such reputation scores could yield unsuccessful collaborations that hurt the marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tripp and Grégoire 2011)</ref>. As a result, there is a need for exploring alternative reputation systems that could potentially address these shortcomings and provide more representative reputation scores.</p><p>2.2.2. Do existing reputation systems address these shortcomings? Section 2.1 classifies current reputation systems into human-based, machine-based, and hybrid. The presented commercial applications of human-based reputation systems experience reputation inflation, and to a certain degree, reputation attribution and reputation staticity. In particular, e-commerce reputation scores are inflated <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Hu et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hu et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">, Zervas et al. 2015</ref>) due to response bias-i.e., who chooses to rate a service <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Moe and Schweidel 2012)</ref>-and due to acquisition bias-i.e., buyers typically choose services that they expect to like <ref type="bibr">(Hu et al. 2017)</ref>. Reputation attribution appears when products receive unidimensional ratings describing multiple dimensions (e.g., value for money, appearance, durability). TripAdvisor acknowledges the issue of reputation attribution and o↵ers reputation scores in four secondary dimensions (i.e., location, cleanliness, service, value). Even though such multidimensional systems better describe service quality, they do not generalize to an arbitrary set of dimensions, and they usually rely on a few dimensions that humans can e ciently rate. Finally, because some of the rated products or services are dynamic (e.g., venues evolve on TripAdvisor), their respective reputation systems likely experience reputation staticity.</p><p>Machine-based link analysis approaches require a network of interactions related to service quality in order to work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jurczyk and Agichtein 2007)</ref>. At the same time, they do not rely on any evaluation measure (either objective through testing or subjective through human raters). Hence, their applicability to contexts that require human-perceived service quality, such as online work, is limited. Applicability is also an issue for hybrid-based reputation systems (Section 2.1.3) that either focus on di↵erent objectives (e.g., node quality in peer-to-peer networks; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Damiani et al. 2002)</ref> or require information that is not freely available (e.g., social behavior; see <ref type="bibr">Sabater and Sierra 2001b)</ref> in online labor markets. Overall, these machine-based and hybrid approaches do not focus on addressing reputation inflation, reputation attribution, and reputation staticity, as these shortcomings do not pose significant limitations in their respective contexts (i.e., peer-to-peer networks and question-answering communities).</p><p>One could argue that given the contextual similarities between crowdsourcing settings and online labor markets, their reputation systems (Section 2.1.3) could be applicable in both contexts. Digital workplaces, however, di↵er from many crowdsourcing settings in that workers are highly paid and highly skilled <ref type="bibr">(Paolacci et al. 2010, Kokkodis and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ipeirotis 2014)</ref>. As a result, the objective of crowdsourcing systems to filter out adversarial workers does not apply to the focal context, as none of the high-skilled workers in online labor markets will purposely perform subpar work (e.g., by mindlessly labeling images, which is a typical task on AMT).

Specifically, these principles are <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(1)</ref> decomposition of any arbitrary combination of skills into a set of finite competency dimensions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(2)</ref> dynamic estimation of competency-specific reputation, and (3) on-demand aggregation of these competency-specific reputations to estimate skillset-specific reputation scores. The first principle solves reputation attribution, as it allows for the e cient decomposition of reputation to a finite set of competency dimensions. The second principle allows for competency-specific dynamic estimation of quality and directly addresses reputation staticity. The third principle creates skillset-specific estimates of quality. Since human abilities follow normal-like distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schmidt and Hunter 1983)</ref>, accurate skillset-specific reputation scores address reputation inflation and facilitate worker di↵erentiation.</p></div>

Traditional recommenders predict the rating a user would assign to an item <ref type="bibr">(Ricci et al. 2011, Adamopoulos and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Tuzhilin 2014)</ref>. To apply these systems in the focal context, we need to map ratings, users, and items to their respective entities in a worker-reputation framework for online labor markets.</p><p>Since workers' reputation is the desired outcome of the framework, workers map to a recommender system's users.</p><p>The mapping of items and ratings is more complicated. In traditional recommender systems, the items are static entities that do not evolve over time (e.g., movies, smartphones, songs). Besides, multiple users of traditional recommender systems buy, experience, and rate identical items (e.g., the same movie, song, smartphone). These multiple ratings per item are necessary for algorithms such as collaborative filtering to provide item recommendations that similar users to the focal user have liked in the past <ref type="bibr">(Koren 2009, Adamopoulos and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Tuzhilin 2013)</ref>. In the focal context, the rated items are the completed tasks. In online labor markets, very rarely (if ever) two tasks are identical; even tasks that require the same skills might have di↵erent objectives. As a result, we do not observe multiple ratings for each task; instead, each task receives only a single rating. Hence, to transform recommender systems to a worker-reputation framework, we need to create static items for which multiple workers receive ratings.</p><p>A straightforward noisy transformation is to consider tasks that require the same skillsets as identical items. Then, the skillset-specific average feedback score that each worker receives can map to a recommended item's rating.

Based on these principles, I structure a reputation framework (HMM-W2V-framework) that consists of three components. Component A focuses on decomposing skills into competency dimensions that allow the framework to generalize and accommodate any arbitrary number of skills. Component B builds a dynamic model that combines multiple signals to estimate a worker's current, competency-specific quality. Component C aggregates competency-specific predictions to get a current estimate of the worker's quality on any set of skills. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> draws the interconnections of these three components, which I describe in detail next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Component A: Skills decomposition</head><p>Workers can work on any arbitrary combination of skills, which creates a space of tens of thousands of available combinations of unique skillsets (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).

Second, such observations would ignore (by construction) correlations between various skillsets. Third, the entrance of new skills would require retraining of the framework.</p><p>To overcome these drawbacks, I use a distributed representation of words model (Word Embedding, W2V; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Mikolov et al. 2013</ref>) that projects individual skills into a set of competency dimensions.</p><p>W2V embeds words from a vocabulary into a lower-dimensional space, in which semantically similar words appear close to each other, while semantically dissimilar words appear far away from each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Mikolov et al. 2013</ref>). In the context of online work, a "skill" maps to a "word" and a "skillset" to a "document."

The y axis shows the 10-fold cross-validated percentage improvement of the HMM-W2V-framework over the x axis reputation systems, in terms of Spearman ⇢ and Kendall ⌧ . These ranking correlations capture how aligned each reputation system's ranking is with the observed performance of the workers. Across both metrics, the proposed approach significantly outperforms both current and alternative reputation systems: The HMM-W2V-framework yields, on average, ⇠85% better rankings than the current reputation scores. At the same time, it significantly (p &lt; 0.001) yields better rankings than all alternative reputation systems (average improvement between 20% and 60%). Hence, the ordering of workers according to their predicted HMM-W2V reputation is significantly more accurate than their orderings according to alternative reputation systems.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref> show the ranking performance and lift improvement of the proposed approach over alternative reputation systems. The x axis ranks workers according to their predicted reputation scores by each alternative approach. The y axis shows the HMM-W2V reputation improvement over each alternative approach (A) in terms of the observed performance of the top-ranked workers, and (B) in terms of lift (i.e., how much better top-ranked workers perform than bottom-ranked workers). In Figure <ref type="figure">A</ref>, the HMM-W2V-framework significantly outperforms (up to 8%, p &lt; 0.001) all alternative reputation systems: According to HMM-W2V reputation, higher-ranked workers yield significantly higher average performance. As the ranking moves from top to bottom, the improvement of the HMM-W2V reputation converges to zero as the top-ranked cohort includes a larger portion of the available contractors (i.e., the top-ranked sample's average performance converges to the population's average performance). Note that there is not a single point on the</p><p>x axis where an alternative reputation system outperforms the HMM-W2V-framework. Similarly, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>, the proposed framework yields a higher average lift (up to 9%, p &lt; 0.001) than all alternative approaches. This means that the rates of the HMM-W2V reputation top-ranked worker performance over the bottom-ranked worker performance are significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher than the respective rates of all alternative reputation systems.  each resulting distribution is to the normal distribution. A normal distribution is more likely to represent the skillset-specific abilities of workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schmidt and Hunter 1983)</ref> and facilitate worker di↵erentiation. The total variation distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Huber 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Kohl 2019</ref>) between any two distributions captures how close these distributions are. Hence, I use this distance to measure the closeness of each alternative reputation distribution to the normal distribution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> shows that the proposed approach yields reputation distributions that are up to 37% closer to a normal distribution (p &lt; 0.001) compared with the resulting distributions of alternative reputation systems.</p></div>

I use these next-skillset-score predictions to infer a worker's skillset-specific reputation.</p><p>Through a grid search approach, I tune these models, and compare their performance with the HMM-W2V-framework. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows how the proposed approach significantly (p &lt; 0.001) outperforms all recommender systems in terms of ranking correlations. This underperformance shows that the necessary assumptions that transform recommender systems into worker-reputation frameworks likely hurt their performance.

One such example is online reputation platforms (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp). These platforms deliver positively skewed reputation scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Luca and Zervas 2016)</ref>. At the same time, because venues evolve (e.g., change their menus, go through renovations, hire di↵erent personnel), their reputation is also dynamic. Finally, these restaurants receive evaluations for multiple dimensions, and as a result, their reputation systems likely experience reputation attribution as well. Appendix E implements the HMM-W2V-framework and the alternative reputation and recommender systems on 77,044 restaurant reviews from a major restaurant review platform: The HMM-W2V-framework provides significantly (p &lt; 0.001) better restaurant reputation scores compared with alternative reputation systems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">14</ref>) and adaptations of popular recommender systems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">15</ref>).

The focal restaurant review platform creates a perfect environment to test this, as it allows customers to rate venues across four dimensions: "Food," "Atmosphere," "Value," and "Service." Appendix E and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">16</ref> compare the HMM-W2V-framework with alternative approaches that use as input these human-rated reputation dimensions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Current reputation systems in online labor markets experience three shortcomings: (1) reputation attribution (attribution of reputation to specific skills is infeasible), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) reputation staticity (the assumption that worker quality is static and does not evolve), and (3) reputation inflation (feedback scores are positively skewed). To address these shortcomings, this work presents the HMM-W2V-framework, which combines human input (assigned feedback scores) with machine learning (Word Embedding, Hidden Markov Models) to provide accurate quality estimates for any online worker on any given set of skills. The proposed framework includes three components. The first component maps skills into a latent space of finite competency dimensions and addresses reputation attribution. The second builds dynamic competency-specific quality assessment models and addresses reputation staticity. The final component aggregates these competency-specific assessments to generate a reputation score for any given set of skills. Because these reputation scores are skillset-specific and evolve over time, they generate a representative, closer-to-normal reputation distribution, hence addressing reputation inflation. Application of the proposed framework to two di↵erent datasets illustrates that, compared with alternative reputation systems, HMM-W2V reputation performs better in terms of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) ranking workers according to their likelihood of performing well, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) identifying "non-perfect" workers who are more likely to underperform and are harder to predict, (3) improving the ranking of within-opening choices, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">4</ref>) creating closer-to-normal reputation distributions that facilitate worker di↵erentiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Research contributions</head><p>Given the projected growth of the number of online workers in the coming years (Agile-1 2016, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Sundararajan 2016</ref>) and their dynamic nature <ref type="bibr">(Oliver 2015, Kokkodis and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ipeirotis 2016)</ref>, accurate quality assessment could be a defining factor of the ultimate reach of online work. This paper is the first to outline shortcomings of current reputation systems (i.e., reputation staticity and reputation attribution) and to explain why such systems underperform in this context. By identifying these shortcomings, this work provides a solution that generalizes to arbitrary sets of skills. Because it makes skillset-specific estimates that dynamically evolve, this work provides accurate skillset-specific reputation.</p><p>From a design perspective, this work extends the rich literature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) of reputation systems by combining human input with machine intelligence to enhance employer judgment in choosing appropriate online workers. Compared with previous human-based, machine-based, and hybrid reputation systems, the proposed approach has unique dynamic attributes that fit the particular context of online work. Given that algorithmic collaboration between humans and machines is expected to grow <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Jain et al. 2018)</ref>, the proposed hybrid approach could be a baseline for future intelligence augmentation systems that could potentially use human input beyond the current uniform worker assessment (e.g., by having employers rating workers only in dimensions that employers have appropriate expertise in, or by using expert, third-party human raters).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Methodological contributions and generalizability</head><p>Methodologically, this paper provides a detailed guideline for markets that are interested in developing dynamic reputation systems by addressing methodological challenges that include the conceptualization, modeling, and estimation of a worker's reputation. Specifically: ⇧ Skillset decomposition: This paper is the first to conceptualize skillsets as documents and propose the application of a text-analysis algorithm in a completely di↵erent context. As discussed in Sections 2 and 3 and illustrated in Appendix C and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>, this decomposition is necessary, as it allows the proposed reputation framework to generalize on any number of available skills.</p><p>⇧ HMM architecture: Section 3.2 describes how practitioners can conceptualize and formulate a suitable structure for an HMM that allows a series of observed signals to shape the transition and emission probabilities of workers of various qualities.</p><p>⇧ Parameter estimation: Appendix B guides practitioners through the derivation of the global likelihood of the model and the estimation process of all the parameters. ⇧ Design choices and evaluation: Appendix C presents the process of evaluating di↵erent components of the HMM-W2V-framework and selecting an appropriate configuration of the HMM. Section 5 and Appendices C and D guide practitioners on how to evaluate and compare alternative design choices and reputation systems.</p><p>These methodological contributions generalize beyond the focal context of online work. The HMM-W2V-framework can be adjusted and implemented in any online platform that experiences reputation attribution, reputation staticity, and reputation inflation. For instance, Appendix E shows that, under the assumption that hotels and restaurants dynamically change, reputation platforms such as Yelp and TripAdvisor could use a similar framework to develop a more dynamic, up-to-date reputation system. Sharing economy platforms such as Uber and Lyft can borrow ideas from the proposed approach and develop similar reputation systems internally. Such internal systems could estimate the dynamic service quality of each driver and even identify heterogeneity in reputation across various types of trips (e.g., airport and train station trips, long trips out of town, trips in rush hour, Saturday night trips). Finally, online platforms that track workers' career paths, such as LinkedIn, can adapt the proposed approach and estimate the evolving expertise of their users across multiple skillsets. Recommender systems could then use such estimates to suggest new skills or promote workers to potentially relevant jobs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Implications for platforms, workers, employers, and the future of work</head><p>Online labor platforms stand to benefit through implementing the proposed approach, as accurate reputation scores (1) help workers to di↵erentiate, (2) guide employers to make informed and fast (reduced search cost; see Bakos 1997) decisions, and (3) enable the market to improve its recommendation algorithms. When workers can be accurately di↵erentiated, the quality of the supply side of the market naturally increases. High-quality relevant workers are more likely to keep participating as they are in high demand. Lower-quality workers could be motivated to invest in di↵erent skills that are uncorrelated with their current skillset and respective reputation. At the same time, and as I showed in Section 2.3 and Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>, markets can improve the performance of their recommendation algorithms by using HMM-W2V reputation as an additional attribute. Better recommendations imply higher income and higher transaction e cacy <ref type="bibr">(Kokkodis et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The performance of the proposed approach in terms of identifying "non-perfect" workers is of particular importance to market managers. Accurately predicting underperformance allows informing employers preemptively. Such interventions could potentially reduce the number of adverse outcomes. Employers who make better-informed and faster decisions that lead to better outcomes are more likely to be happy and keep participating in the marketplace, thereby generating a continuous stream of revenue for the platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tripp and Grégoire 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Through the proposed reputation framework, platforms can better understand the supply distributions across latent competencies and any arbitrary combination of skills. Based on such information, market managers can intervene where they deem appropriate (e.g., through targeted advertising on competencies that workers tend to underperform). Appendix H empirically analyzes the focal dimensions and explains how market managers can track worker performance and employer demand across competencies and devise appropriate interventions.</p><p>The proposed reputation framework combines human input (feedback scores) with machine learning (AI) to augment intelligence in decision making. Over time, through continuous training, the AI component of the framework will improve its performance. As the framework becomes better and more accurate, its e↵ect on humans (both workers and employers) who interact with it will also intensify. Specifically, the AI framework will be facilitating increased di↵erentiation of intelligent crowd and crowd abilities. Due to better di↵erentiation, employers who interact with the system will be able to make intelligent decisions that likely lead to successful outcomes. Such outcomes could encourage participation in these markets and attract new employers. Similarly, workers that the system evaluates to have high relevant expertise will be able to find tasks to complete online seamlessly. On the other hand, the framework might marginalize workers that it does not evaluate as experts. For such workers, career development systems can provide recommendations for new skills to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Kokkodis and Ipeirotis 2020)</ref>. At the same time, as the IA framework's performance improves, it will potentially allow new workers (without prior history on the platform) to complete tasks for which the system deems workers with history on the platform as inadequate. As a result, a better IA system will likely help workers with high-in-demand skills and abilities to succeed, and it will potentially drive workers who exercise low-demand skills to consider reskilling. These e↵ects of augmented intelligence could extend to o✏ine work, as the proposed framework could generalize (for instance, through LinkedIn) to o✏ine worker reputation. As automation keeps evolving, the nature of many jobs will change, while other jobs will become obsolete <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Brynjolfsson et al. 2018)</ref>. This transition will require many workers to learn new skills: By some estimates, 120 million workers worldwide will need to be retrained as a result of automation in the next three years (Institute of Business Value 2019). Given this dynamic evolution of skills and workers, a reputation framework such as the one proposed in this work could successfully facilitate supply redistribution while intelligently di↵erentiating relevant hireable workers.</p></div>

Given that the HMM-W2V-framework already provides continuous worker scores, the additional complexity of these models does not guarantee better performance.</p><p>Even further, latent-space models might not provide clear market insights to managers: Because workers will not reside in discrete latent states, competency-specific market analysis (such as the one in Appendix H) will require threshold tuning.</p><p>Through the examination of di↵erent transition functions (Appendix A), I concluded that for the focal dataset, multinomial transitions yield better results. By definition, multinomial transitions allow workers to downgrade to lower-quality states. This might appear irrational at first: why would a worker's quality decrease over time? The way that an HMM works might provide some rationale. Because each HMM focuses on accurately capturing a worker's latent quality, more worker observations will generate less-noisy estimates of the worker's quality. For instance, consider a worker who receives high feedback scores in early tasks and low feedback scores in later tasks.</p><p>The HMM will (likely) initially assign this worker to a high-quality state. As the HMM evaluates new evidence, it will (likely) adjust the worker to a lower-quality state. As a result, allowing transitions to lower-quality states is vital for the HMM-W2V-framework in order to correct and adjust worker-quality estimates as new information arrives. Appendix I discusses this process in greater detail, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">18</ref> empirically shows the benefits of facilitating unconstrained HMM transitions.</p><p>An additional concern for the proposed approach is that platforms are already developing multidimensional reputation systems, and as a result, the HMM-W2V-framework might be only recovering noisy information from such human-rated dimensions. To investigate, Appendix H presents the skills that define each competency in the focal dataset. The complexity of these competency-specific skillsets demonstrate the mental load that humans would need to follow to decompose evaluations across di↵erent dimensions. Furthermore, in a human-rating scenario, the mapping of each skill to a non-primary dimension (that the proposed framework does automatically) would be practically infeasible. For instance, if a worker completes a data-mining job, a human rater would evaluate the worker's performance in that skill, but not in every other skill available on the market (e.g., video-production). The HMM-W2V-framework does this mapping automatically, as it implicitly estimates correlations between skills through the W2V decomposition (Section 3.1).</p><p>Appendix H discusses this in detail, and Appendix E.3 empirically shows that the proposed mapping captures di↵erent information than the already implemented human-rated dimensions.</p><p>Finally, the fact that, compared with D2V, W2V was a more appropriate decomposition approach in the worker-reputation context (Appendix C.1) but less appropriate in the restaurant-reputation context (Appendix E) raises a question of when should markets prefer W2V over D2V. Conceptually, W2V is likely to perform better when the pool of terms is predefined, well-structured, and where every term includes crucial information. In these scenarios, where each individual term (e.g., a skill) contains crucial information, summing up mappings through Equation 1 should generate more informative representations than D2V mappings that will unavoidably include noise from rare combinations of terms (e.g., rare combinations of skills). On the other hand, D2V should perform better when the analyzed text is unstructured (e.g., review text). In those cases, summing up weights of seemingly random terms (e.g., found in reviews) through Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>will likely generate noisy representations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparison of alternative design choices</head><p>The three components of the framework require hyper-parameter tuning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1. Alternative modeling choices for component A</head><p>Component A of the HMM-W2V-framework is required in order to map skillsets into a vector space of real numbers. To achieve this, in Section 3.1, I used a W2V approach. Alternative approaches can also achieve this mapping. For instance, document embedding (D2V, Le and Mikolov 2014) can directly map each skillset into numeric vectors. Even further, simpler clustering approaches can also perform this task. For instance, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM; see Murphy 2012) can provide membership weights for each skill to any number of predefined clusters. Finally, an alternative approach could also consider the raw text from job descriptions. To test this, I implement the proposed W2V approach (Section 3.1) on the job-description text that includes the task's required skills (W2V-D). 5   To compare these four alternative modeling choices for component A, I follow a grid search approach. Specifically, I estimate the 10-fold cross-validated ranking correlations (Spearman ⇢) of each approach for the following parameter combinations:</p><p>Component A grid-search:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">⇢ Component A z }| { {W2V, D2V, GMM, W2V-D} ⇥ |D| z }| { {5, 10, 15} .<label>(26)</label></formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11A</ref> shows the results. The y axis shows improvement over the proposed W2V approach described in Section 3.1. The results show that W2V performs significantly (p &lt; 0.05) better than the alternative approaches for the focal dataset. As a result, for the main analysis of this work, I use W2V. (For other contexts, one of the alternative approaches could be more appropriate. For instance, for the restaurant review dataset described in Appendix E, D2V worked better.)</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref> shows how W2V maps a randomly selected subset of skills into a reduced (through stochastic neighbor embedding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Hinton and Roweis 2003)</ref> two-dimensional space. The plot reveals hidden contextual similarities between skills. For instance, it shows that employers who request C++ usually also request SQLite, while employers who request Python usually also request MongoDB.</p><p>The plot hence suggests that Python is contextually closer to MongoDB than SQLite.</p></div>

Alternative modeling choices for component B</head><p>For implementing component B of the HMM-W2V-framework that addresses reputation staticity, the main analysis uses an HMM. Other modeling approaches can also capture such a dynamic evolution of sequential observations. For instance, recurrent neural networks can capture such evaluations through Long Short Term Memory networks <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997)</ref>. In addition, I benchmark such dynamic approaches with simple (linear regression models-LM) and powerful regression approaches (SVM-regression and gradient boosting-XGBoost).</p><p>5 I train these approaches on a separate dataset of 40,000 job-opening skillsets.

The y axis shows the percentage improvement of the HMM approach over the alternative approaches of modeling component B: It becomes clear that modeling dynamic transitions through a hidden Markov model performs significantly (p &lt; 0.001) better than all alternative approaches for the focal dataset. One reason that could explain the underperformance of the LSTM approach, in particular, is the fact that the analyzed sequences are short (median completed tasks per worker is 5, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Perhaps, in larger datasets with longer sequences, LSTM could have been a more appropriate choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.3. Alternative modeling choices for component C</head><p>Section 3.3 aggregates dimension-specific scores through a simple summation equation. Alternatively, an aggregation function could linearly regress each dimension (LM). Such a function could identify dimensions that consistently provide erroneous estimates and underweight them. Another aggregation function could project the reputation score of the dimension with the maximum weight (Max). In theory, such an approach would rely on the dimension that is more relevant to the skillset at hand to make a reputation estimate.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of each alternative modeling choice of component C I follow a similar grid search approach to before, and estimate the 10-fold cross-validated ranking correlations (Spearman ⇢) of each approach for the following parameter combinations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">Component C grid-search: ⇢ Component C z }| { {Sum, LM, Max} ⇥ |D| z }| { {5, 10, 15} .<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11C</ref> shows the results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Generalizability: Application in online reputation platforms</head><p>The proposed approach, in theory, generalizes to other contexts that experience reputation inflation, reputation staticity, and reputation attribution. One such context is online reputation platforms (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor). These platforms experience reputation inflation <ref type="bibr">(Luca 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hu et al. 2017)</ref>. At the same time, like contractors, venues (restaurants, hotels) in these platforms evolve.</p><p>For instance, one venue might do a renovation, change menu o↵erings, hire a new chef, or change management. Hence, reputation staticity might also be present. Finally, because venues (like workers) are multidimensional entities, unidimensional ratings suggest the existence of reputation attribution.</p><p>It is important to highlight that some unique characteristics of online labor markets do not transfer to this alternative context. Specifically, in online labor markets, we are interested in estimating a skillset-specific reputation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The framework achieves this by observing skillset-specific evaluations for each worker. On the contrary, in online reputation platforms, there is no observed equivalent of skillsets. Reviewers rate their overall experience, and sometimes, they explain what they like and what they did not like in the review text. The proposed framework decomposes this text to latent dimensions, but the outcome of the framework is not "skillset-equivalent"-specific anymore. Nevertheless, the framework can be adjusted to this alternative context to provide current restaurant reputation scores. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> summarizes the di↵erences in objectives and data availability between the main and this alternative context. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.2. Comparison with recommender systems</head><p>The restaurant-reputation context is closer to recommender systems than the focal worker-reputation context. Specifically, in this context, a mapping for recommender systems that could provide restaurant reputation is:</p><p>• Reviewer 7 ! user.</p><p>• Restaurant rating 7 ! rating.</p><p>• Restaurant 7 ! item.</p><p>Compared with the main context, because in this context there is no objective restaurant equivalent of "skillset-specific" reputation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>), restaurants map directly to items. In addition, reviewers rarely rate the same restaurant twice; hence, compared with online labor markets where workers get rated for the same skills repeatedly and I had to average their skillset-specific ratings (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), restaurant ratings map directly to the recommender systems ratings. Finally, in online reputation platforms, it is reasonable to assume that reviewers are the recommender system's users, as every user's objective is to dine at a restaurant; instead, in online labor markets, it is not as reasonable to recommend workers to employers without considering the type of jobs and required skills that employers are looking for.</p><p>Given this more straightforward fit of recommender systems, I expect them to perform better compared with their performance in predicting worker-reputation scores (Section 5.4). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">15</ref> shows the results. Indeed, explicit-feedback recommender systems perform better in this context than in online labor markets (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Yet, and similar to online labor markets, the HMM-W2V-framework significantly (p &lt; 0.001) outperforms these approaches, as it better captures restaurant evolution through the multi-dimensional HMM modeling (standard collaborative filtering approaches do not model item (restaurant) evolution). Finally, note that the proposed framework outperforms nextitem recommenders (CNN) on average by 400% (p &lt; 0.001), as the necessary encoding (Section 5.  The HMM-W2V-framework significantly outperforms adaptations of recommender systems in this alternative context.</p><p>As a result, it provides more accurate restaurant-reputation scores. The improvement of the HMM-W2V-framework over the deep learning recommender framework (CNN) is over 400%. I omit this point for presentation clarity. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.3. Comparison with human-rated dimensions</head><p>One concern of the proposed approach is that platforms are already developing multidimensional reputation systems, and as a result, the HMM-W2V-framework might be only recovering noisy information from such humanly rated dimensions. The focal restaurant review platform is an ideal context to test this, as it allows customers to rate venues across four dimensions: "Food," "Atmosphere," "Value," and "Service." Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">16</ref> compares the HMM-W2V-framework with alternative approaches that use these human-inputted multidimensional reputation scores as input. Specifically, these approaches estimate the following specification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">Y t ⇠ G(Z t 1 , X t , Food t 1 , Ātmosphere t 1 , Value t 1 , Service t 1 ) ,<label>(35)</label></formula><p>where G 2 {LM, LSTM, SVM, XGBoost} and Mit 1 is the average reputation score of dimension M up to time t 1, M 2 {'Food", "Atmosphere," "Value," "Service"}. The proposed approach significantly (p &lt; 0.001) outperforms these alternative specifications. This suggests that the latent dimensions captured by the focal framework contain di↵erent information than the observed multidimensional feedback scores.</p><p>• Competency-5: {data-scraping, google-spreadsheet, format-and-layout, data-entry, webscraping, pdf-conversion, microsoft-excel}</p><p>• Competency-6: {portuguese, chinese, german, dutch, japanese, french, spanish, russian, italian}</p><p>• Competency-7: {business-analysis, internet-research, data-entry, market-research, business-plans}</p><p>• Competency-8: {translation-english-vietnamese, translation-english-italian, translation-englishportuguese, translation-english-korean, translation-english-malay }</p><p>• Competency-9: {medical-writing, writing, creative-writing, writing-slang-style, recipe-writing, article-writing, content-writing} Through Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>, each skillset maps to all competencies.

For instance, when a worker receives a rating that primarily evaluates the worker's performance on a given skillset (e.g., video-production and final-cut-pro, competency-0), the rating maps to all competencies, allowing the framework to estimate an e↵ect of this rating in seemingly uncorrelated competencies <ref type="bibr">(e.g., competency-8)</ref>. This unique characteristic of the proposed skillset-mapping approach demonstrates that it goes beyond any future human-rated dimensions, such as the ones discussed in Appendix E.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H.2. Competency-specific demand and supply</head><p>Once I know the skillset representation for each competency, I can identify competencies for which demand is higher than the supply of good workers. In particular, I first identify (through simulations) how many workers exist in the highest-quality state within each competency. This is a proxy of the supply of capable competency-specific workers. Then, I estimate the number of available job openings within each competency. This is a proxy of the competency-specific demand.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">17</ref> shows the scatterplot of the normalized competency-specific demand with the normalized competency-specific supply. The dashed line is the diagonal (slope = 45 degrees). Points below the diagonal represent high demand and low supply of good-quality workers. Points above the diagonal represent high supply of good workers and lower demand. Based on this analysis, the most (Spearman ⇢). As mentioned in Appendix C.5 and is evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">18A</ref>, multinomial transitions perform significantly (p &lt; 0.001) better than both ordered logit and constrained ordered logit transitions.</p><p>Of particular interest is the comparison between the constrained and unconstrained ordered logit functions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">18A</ref> shows that an ordered logit without constrains performs slightly (p &lt; 0.05) better. In other words, empirical evidence suggests that restricting transitions to higher-quality states hurts the performance of the model. This is in line with the expected behavior of the HMM-W2V-framework, as it continuously uses new evidence to update its quality estimates for each worker (Section 6.4).</p><p>To examine the frequency with which workers transition to lower-quality states, I simulate worker paths on the learned competency-specific HMMs and count the times that workers transition to a lower-quality state. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">18B</ref> shows that, on average, one out of five observed transitions is to a lower-quality state. This observation further highlights the need for the proposed framework to allow lower-state transitions in order to dynamically adjust and update its quality estimations for each worker.

These scores (Y d t ) form a sequence of proxies of the worker's quality in each competency dimension d 2 D. In addition to latent, a worker's quality dynamically evolves. Specifically, a worker's quality can change in any competency dimension, either by gaining experience on the platform and better understanding the expectations of the employers or by learning new skills and continuously expanding current knowledge and abilities. The HMM-W2V-framework formulates this evolution through a hidden Markov model (HMM): Each worker operates from a latent, competency-specific state, which determines the worker's propensity to perform with score Y d t . Every time a worker completes a new task and receives a new feedback score, the framework observes new evidence about the worker's competency-specific qualities and stochastically transitions the worker to new latent states. The framework assumes a set of S d latent states that describe K d di↵erent levels of quality for each competency d, S d = {s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s K d }.HMM structure: Every new worker who joins the platform has an unknown quality across the competency dimensions d 2 D. As the worker completes new tasks on the platform, the market observes signals (i.e., through task outcomes) that correlate with the latent worker quality. To capture this behavior, the HMM-W2V-framework assumes an initial latent state s 1 , where all new workers land. This state makes an average initial estimate of workers' competency-specific quality. 2 Once 2 Alternatively, workers could land stochastically to any of the available states. This would add noise to the estimates, and as a result it could potentially hurt the performance of the framework.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Summary of comparisons: Overall, and based on this analysis, it becomes clear that each component of the framework contributes to the observed performance. Specifically, compared with alternative design choices, (1) using W2V for component A increases the framework's performance by up to 6%, (2) using an HMM in component B increases the framework's performance by up to 43% (Figure <ref type="figure">11B</ref>), and (3) using Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>to aggregate dimension-specific reputation estimates increases the performance of the framework by up to 13% (Figure <ref type="figure">11C</ref>). Finally, including component A and using |D| = 10 increases the performance of the framework by up to⇠ 17% (Figure <ref type="figure">11D</ref>).</p></div>

(The support of the Beta distribution is by default 2 [0, 1]). Finally, I consider the following number of states:</p><p>To choose the most appropriate combination for the focal dataset, I estimate the configurations that yield the lowest 10-fold cross-validated Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Schwarz 1978</ref><ref type="bibr">, Murphy 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">, Koller and Friedman 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">, Bishop 2006)</ref>.

Similarly, vector X t includes the restaurant's current reputation.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref> shows the results. The y axis shows the improvement of the proposed approach over alternative reputation systems, in terms of 10-fold cross-validated ranking correlations. The HMM-D2V framework significantly (p &lt; 0.001) outperforms all alternative reputation systems, providing more accurate and current rankings of the listed venues.</p><p>6 D2V likely works better in this context because review text is unstructured and unique. Conceptually, summing up weights of seemingly random words found in reviews through Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>will generate noisy representations. On the contrary, summing up mappings of structured skill terms through W2V in the online labor market context should generate more informative representations, as each individual single skill contains crucial information.</p></div>

Predictive features for job-applicant recommendations</head><p>To form vector W p and build the job-applicant recommender systems described in Section 5.4.2, I use the same set of predictive variables as in <ref type="bibr">Kokkodis et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Data-driven managerial insights</head><p>Section 3 describes the mapping process of skillsets to latent competency dimensions (W2V).</p><p>The actual competencies' representations remain hidden, as the framework's primary goal is to provide worker-reputation scores. However, the decomposition of skillsets could provide interesting managerial insights. To illustrate, in this appendix, I examine each competency and try to extract market information that could guide managerial interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H.1. Competency-specific skillsets</head><p>Which are the most representative skillsets in each competency? Recall that all skillsets decompose to all competencies (Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>). The skillsets that decompose to high weights within each competency are the ones that are more representative and allow workers to transition to higher competencyspecific quality states. This is modeled explicitly in in the definition of the HMM observations (i.e., Y d t = w d R Y t ). Hence, I can identify the skillset-specific workers' qualities that each competency captures by extracting the skillsets with the largest weights. Specifically, for each of the ten competencies I consider, the top five weighted skillsets include the following skills:</p><p>• Competency-0: {video-production, final-cut-pro, voice-over, video-postediting, video-editing, youtube-marketing}</p><p>• Competency-1: {brochure-design, print-design, print-layout-design, illustration}</p><p>• Competency-2: {manual-testing, software-testing, software-qa-testing, functional-testing}</p><p>• Competency-3: {google-adwords, google-analytics, google-adsense, ppc-advertising, sem}</p><p>• Competency-4: {android-app-development, 3d-rendering, unity-3d, rest, node.js, objective-c, angularjs} Normalized demand (job openings) Normalized supply (high-quality workers)</p><p>The y axis shows the normalized supply of high-quality workers (i.e., workers in the highest-quality state in each competency). The x axis shows the normalized competency-specific demand (i.e., job openings). The dashed line is the diagonal (slope = 45 degrees). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals of simulated worker paths.</p><p>in-demand competency that lacks high-quality workers is competency-6, which includes languagerelated skillsets. Platform managers can look into the origins of this demand-supply discrepancy and try to attract (new) workers with foreign language skills. On the other hand, competency-7 seems to provide an oversupply of high-quality workers with expertise in business analysis, and internet research. Hence, managers do not need to target workers in this competency at this moment.</p><p>To summarize, the HMM-W2V-framework allows managers to get deeper market insights through a formal latent-competency and hidden-state analysis, without the need to manually combine skillsets, identify thresholds of high-quality workers, and make assumptions of the current quality of each worker. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Discussion of worker competency-specific transitions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J. Markov assumption</head><p>The HMM approach assumes that the next state of each worker depends on the current state of the worker and the set of observed characteristics Z it 1 , X t . The presented results in Sections 5, 2.3 and Appendix D show that this assumption does not significantly hurt the performance of the framework.</p><p>There are multiple reasons that explain this. First, even though the Markovian assumption suggests that the next state depends on the current state, reaching a current state accumulates e↵ects from the complete sequence of observations up to that point <ref type="bibr">(Murphy 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">, Zucchini et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">, Sahoo et al. 2012)</ref>. In other words, the current state essentially encapsulates the likelihood of observing the sequence of states up to that point. Second, the fact that I consider up-to-date observed characteristics to a↵ect both emissions and transitions controls for accumulated information up to that point for each worker (e.g., total number of jobs, accumulated feedback scores). Finally, given that each dimension-specific HMM captures dimension-specific reputation, it is reasonable to assume that the last update of a worker's performance in each dimension is likely the most current representation of the worker's dimension-specific quality.</p><p>To test this last argument, I estimate the predictive performance of varying memory windows for each dimensions d 2 D. Figure <ref type="figure">19</ref> shows the results. The y axis shows the normalized MAE across all dimensions. Increasing the memory window to higher orders <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">4)</ref> appears to not have a significant e↵ect on the predictive performance (p &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Finally, even in scenarios where the Markovian assumption does not seem to fit the data, application of the Viterbi <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Forney 1973</ref>) algorithm would likely solve this issue, as the Viterbi algorithm can estimate the current state of each user by maximizing the likelihood of the sequence of observations up to that point.</p></div>			</div>
